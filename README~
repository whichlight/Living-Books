A script to pull text randomly from a book, and tweet it
This is part of an initiative to 'free' the data of books, and eventually 
make them more interactive in a virtual public space.

requires python-twitter

in the function 'validate()' you stick your twitter api authentication keys.
you can get this by registering an application with twitter.  this is just
telling twitter you are using their api, you can feed the application any name,
and you sign in with twitter. you set the application as read and write (or
something like that) to get access to publishing tweets too.

log.txt will be created and holds all the tweets
book_file is the name of the file where the book is. feed it a txt file. 

Note, you can also erase the whole 'while' loop in main() and only have
'tweet_out()' in main, calling the script using cron every so often.
